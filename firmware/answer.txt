Question 1:
CAN technology is good at handling errors, allowing devices to talk to each other easily, 
and making sure important messages get through first. This means it can send data reliably,
even where there's a lot of interference. Devices can share control without needing central controller, 
making the system more flexible and reliable. Important messages, like emergency brakes in self-driving cars, 
get priority. But, CAN isn't perfect, it can only handle limited amounts of data at a time, 
which might be a problem for tasks needing to send a lot of data.
